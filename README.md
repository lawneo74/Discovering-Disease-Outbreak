# Manning LiveProject - Data Science Bootcamp: Discovering Disease Outbreak from News

This liveProject is based on a case study from the Manning book Data Science Bookcamp by Leonard Apeltsin.

Play the role of Data Scientist as World Health Organization (WHO) and identify disease outbreaks around the world using data science techniques in Python.

The tasks:
- (Step 1) Extract the locations (city and/or country name) from each news headline.
- Find the geographic coordinates of each headline using the city/country.
- Cluster (group) the headlines based on the geographic location.
- Visualize the clusters on a map and analyze them for patterns indicating an epidemic.
- Investigate the largest clusters for signs of disease outbreaks.
- Review headlines in the largest clusters within the United States and around the world. If any disease outbreak is particularly dominant, visualize all worldwide mentions of that disease.
- Provide a summary of your findings to your superiors at the WHO so they can direct resources.
